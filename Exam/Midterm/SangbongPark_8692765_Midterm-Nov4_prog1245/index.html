            <h1>Ready For The Best Pizza In Town?</h1>
            <p>The secret to our food? It’s pretty simple. Source fresh, quality ingredients. Prepare dishes with care and passion. Serve them with a warm smile. In other words, we take pride in what we make and how we share it. Even though we’ve grown a lot over the years, our mission is still the same:  Always the best food, made especially for you.</p>
            <p>Food Critic Sangbong Park said:</p>
            <blockquote>Some of the world’s best cheese is made close to home! Melty Mozzarella is made with 100% Canadian milk. I am proud to support Canadian dairy farmers.

            <h2>What we offer</h2>
            <h3><a href="#">Good sauce</a></h3>
            <p>Nonna was right. You can’t make great pizza without a great sauce. Our traditional home-style sauce is made with fresh ingredients:  extra virgin olive oil, sunflower oil, oregano, sea salt, black pepper, garlic and, of course, vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh packed within 6 hours of harvest. </p>
            <h3><a href="#">Creamy Cheese</a></h3>
            <p>Some of the world’s best cheese is made close to home! Melty Mozzarella is made with 100% Canadian milk. I am proud to support Canadian dairy farmers.</p>
