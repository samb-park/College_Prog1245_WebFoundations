                                “Dynamite” is a Disco Pop single that sings of joy and confidence,
                                bringing a new surge of much-needed ‘energy’ to reinvigorate the
                                global community.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                In this song, the global superstars find happiness by doing again
                                what they do best: engaging in a perpetual cycle of giving and
                                receiving joy with the world through music and performances.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                It also marks BTS’ first song to be released completely in
                                English; having sought a “breakthrough” to overcome a sense of
                                disheartenment from within the new global climate, BTS embarks on
                                a new challenge through “Dynamite.”

                              <p>
                                The choreography is edgy and upbeat, with deeply addicting
                                movements that highlight the distinct charms of each BTS member.

                            Unveiled last year, the MAP OF THE SOUL series contains the honest
                            and heartfelt story of BTS and their journey of discovering their
                            true selves. The first chapter of this story, “MAP OF THE SOUL :
                            PERSONA”, sang about the world and the joy of love, and the
                            discovery of the self as it is displayed to the world; “MAP OF THE
                            SOUL : 7” now turns inward to the shadow within in a candid
                            acknowledgement that it, too, is part of the self.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” looks back on the past seven years of BTS
                            since their debut as seven members of one team. The journey was
                            not always smooth sailing, and there were special travails that
                            they had to endure in their rise as global superstars. Now,
                            understanding that the scars left by those hardships is a part of
                            their real selves, BTS accepts both “the self I want to show” and
                            the “self I want to scorn” to at last tell their own story of
                            finding their “real and complete selves”.

                            <p>First unveiled in March of 2016, the BTS LOVE YOURSELF series creates a narrative by linking the key songs in each album into a single theme, imparting the message that “loving yourself is true love”. Like a well-written novel having introduction, development, twists, and conclusion it shared a compelling story for two and a half years. 
                            </p>
                            <p>‘ANSWER’ is the final piece of the puzzle. Though it’s a repackaged album, LOVE YOURSELF 結 ‘ANSWER’ still includes seven brand-new tracks. CD A is a concept album, its sixteen tracks all connected lyrically to highlight BTS’ prowess as both artists and storytellers. </p>
